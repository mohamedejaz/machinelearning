Hello! Thanks for taking a minute to see my project.
My project is "STARTUP INVESTMENT PREDICTION"
I have used tools Machine Learning and Data Science tools and Python as my Programming Language.My goal is to train a machine learning model which analyses and predicts the profit of the startups and to get the maximum accuracy possible.
The dataset i used in this project is from Kaggle.com - https://www.kaggle.com/farhanmd29/50-startups
In the last prediction result,the first vector is real profits of the test set and the second vector is the predicted proits of the test set.
The accuracy rate of my model is 93.4%
